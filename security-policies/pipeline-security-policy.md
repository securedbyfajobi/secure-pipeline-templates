# CI/CD Pipeline Security Policy

## Overview

This document defines the security requirements and policies for all CI/CD pipelines in the organization. These policies ensure that security is integrated throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Security Requirements

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

#### Pipeline Access Control
- **Requirement**: All pipeline access must be authenticated and authorized
- **Implementation**:
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all pipeline access
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Regular review of access permissions

#### Service Account Management
- **Requirement**: Use dedicated service accounts for pipeline operations
- **Implementation**:
  - Create specific service accounts for each pipeline
  - Follow principle of least privilege
  - Rotate service account credentials regularly

### 2. Secret Management

#### Secret Storage
- **Requirement**: No secrets in source code or pipeline definitions
- **Implementation**:
  - Use dedicated secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
  - Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit
  - Implement secret rotation policies

#### Secret Access
- **Requirement**: Limit secret access to necessary pipeline stages only
- **Implementation**:
  - Use just-in-time secret access
  - Audit all secret access
  - Implement automatic secret expiration

### 3. Code Security

#### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Requirement**: All code must pass SAST scanning before deployment
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate SonarQube, Snyk, or equivalent tools
  - Set quality gates with defined thresholds
  - Block deployment on critical security findings

#### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- **Requirement**: Web applications must undergo DAST scanning
- **Implementation**:
  - Use OWASP ZAP or equivalent tools
  - Run DAST against staging environments
  - Generate security reports for review

#### Dependency Scanning
- **Requirement**: All dependencies must be scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check, or equivalent
  - Block builds with high/critical vulnerabilities
  - Maintain inventory of third-party components

### 4. Container Security

#### Image Scanning
- **Requirement**: All container images must be scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Trivy, Clair, or equivalent scanners
  - Scan base images and application layers
  - Maintain approved base image registry

#### Runtime Security
- **Requirement**: Container runtime security must be enforced
- **Implementation**:
  - Use read-only root filesystems
  - Run containers as non-root users
  - Implement resource limits and security contexts

### 5. Infrastructure Security

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Requirement**: Infrastructure changes must be reviewed and approved
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Terraform, CloudFormation, or equivalent
  - Implement policy-as-code validation
  - Require peer review for infrastructure changes

#### Environment Isolation
- **Requirement**: Production and non-production environments must be isolated
- **Implementation**:
  - Use separate accounts/subscriptions for environments
  - Implement network segmentation
  - Restrict cross-environment access

### 6. Compliance and Audit

#### Audit Logging
- **Requirement**: All pipeline activities must be logged and auditable
- **Implementation**:
  - Enable comprehensive logging for all pipeline stages
  - Store logs in centralized, tamper-proof storage
  - Implement log retention policies

#### Compliance Validation
- **Requirement**: Pipelines must validate compliance requirements
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement automated compliance checks
  - Generate compliance reports
  - Regular compliance audits and reviews

## Security Controls Implementation

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Example pre-commit hook for secret scanning
#!/bin/bash
git diff --cached --name-only | xargs trufflehog --json --regex | jq 'select(.High==true)'
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  High confidence secrets detected. Commit blocked."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Pipeline Security Gates

#### Quality Gate Thresholds
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0 allowed
- **High Vulnerabilities**: ≤ 5 allowed with justification
- **Code Coverage**: ≥ 80% for security-critical components
- **Compliance Score**: ≥ 95% for all applicable frameworks

#### Approval Requirements
- **Production Deployments**: Require security team approval
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Require infrastructure team approval
- **Emergency Deployments**: Require CISO approval with post-deployment review

### Security Monitoring

#### Real-time Monitoring
- Monitor pipeline execution for anomalies
- Alert on unauthorized access attempts
- Track deployment frequency and success rates

#### Security Metrics
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security issues
- Mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities
- Security test coverage percentage
- Compliance score trends

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Active security breach or data exposure
- **High**: Potential security vulnerability in production
- **Medium**: Security policy violation or configuration issue
- **Low**: Security awareness or training issue

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Stop affected pipelines
   - Isolate compromised systems
   - Notify security team

2. **Investigation**
   - Preserve logs and evidence
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify root cause

3. **Remediation**
   - Implement immediate fixes
   - Update security controls
   - Validate effectiveness

4. **Recovery**
   - Resume normal operations
   - Update documentation
   - Conduct lessons learned

## Training and Awareness

### Required Training
- Secure coding practices
- CI/CD security best practices
- Secret management procedures
- Incident response procedures

### Ongoing Education
- Regular security updates and briefings
- Participation in security exercises
- Sharing of security lessons learned

## Policy Compliance

### Monitoring
- Regular automated policy compliance checks
- Quarterly manual policy reviews
- Annual security assessments

### Enforcement
- Automated blocking of non-compliant deployments
- Progressive discipline for policy violations
- Regular review and update of policies

### Exceptions
- Document all policy exceptions with business justification
- Require security team approval for exceptions
- Time-bound exceptions with regular review
